# JavaScript-Hitesh_Sir
Hi Everyone I am Akash Jaiswal. This year is 2025 and I am pursuing my BTech degree from National Institute of Technology Raipur, India.
Currently I have completed my 1st year in college and summer vacations are going on for others as I am preparing for some web dev and dsa from chai aur code by Hitesh sir and Prateek Jain sir.
This is currently private but as soon as I complete my journey I will make it public 
I wish Best of luck to me for completing this series and Jai Shree Ganesh
